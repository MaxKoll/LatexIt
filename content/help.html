      More about templates
    </h1>
    <p>
      The default template gives a natural, polished look to the LaTeX
      expressions. It uses the "Palatino" font, and includes several AMS
      packages to make it easier to insert symbols and specific features. The
      <tt>mathrsfs</tt> package allows one to use <tt>\mathscr{}</tt> to
      produce English capitals.
    </p>
    <pre>
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsopn}
\usepackage{mathrsfs}
\usepackage{palatino}
\usepackage{mathpazo}
\pagestyle{empty}
\begin{document}
\begin{center}
\LARGE
__REPLACEME__ %this is where your LaTeX expression goes
\end{center}
\end{document}
    </pre>
    <p>
    To insert LaTeX, we first convert <tt>dvi</tt> to <tt>png</tt> through
    <tt>ps</tt>, then we crop the resulting full-page PNG file to a small image
    that only contains the formula. The <tt>\pagestyle{empty}</tt> line removes
    extra output such as page numbers, so that we just need to crop the blank
    areas of the big image to get a small image with only the formula. Without
    this line, there is a page number at the bottom, so cropping doesn't work
    and a huge image is inserted, which is <b>not</b> what we want!
    </p>
    <p>
    The <tt>__REPLACEME__</tt> word will be replaced with the LaTeX expression
    you specified. Therefore, it is important you put it in the right place.
    </p>
    <p>
    We are not using PDFTex but a PS-based production chain, so please keep that
    in mind when using extra packages (i.e. color).
